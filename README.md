# Stock-Price-Prediction

## Introduction

As of April 2018, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) is Asia's 3rd-largest stock exchange ranked by market capitalisation, 
and also the 7th largest in the world. 
With over 2,100 companies listed on the SEHK, there is a wealth of company performance and financial data that can
be used to explore various deep learning approaches that could be applied to predict a company's stock price.


## Project Overview

This project aims to explore 3 different approaches in which deep learning models and techniques can be
implemented to predict stock prices and patterns using Tensorflow and Keras. Specifically, this project utilzes 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the price trend and closing price of a
stock listed on the SEHK using a dataset of past prices.

The aforemetioned approaches of deep learning application to stock price prediction is as follows:

1. Build an RNN model that would predict the price trend of a company's stock; 

2. Perform stock clustering on listed stocks on the SEHK based on their historical price movement; and

3. The Hang Seng Index (HSI) is a market capitalization-weighted index of the largest companies that trade
on the SEHK. We will use Keras to build an LSTM model that would predict the stock price of a company listed 
on the HSI based on its previous historical closing price data.
