# Stock-Price-Prediction using RNN and LSTM

## Introduction

As of April 2018, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) is Asia's 3rd-largest stock exchange ranked by market capitalisation, 
and also the 7th largest in the world. 
With over 2,100 companies listed on the SEHK, there is a wealth of company performance and financial data that can
be used to explore the concept of deep learning and prediction models using various Python libraries.


## Project Overview

This project aims to explore 2 different approaches in which deep learning models and statistical techniques can be
implemented to predict stock prices trends. 

Specifically, the aforemetioned approaches to predict stock price trend and price, respectfully, is as follows:

1. Build an RNN model or Long-short term mememory network that would predict the price trend of a company's stock; and

2. Predict the future price of a company's stock using an ARIMA model.

Once the above is completed, we built a website that mimicked an individual's stock portfolio with the purpose of linking (1) and (2) together. The website link is: [*]


## Methodology

### Predicting stock price trend using an LSTM network

[*]

### Predict the future price of a company's stock using an ARIMA model.

[*]

## Results and Achievements

* Built an LSTM network algorithm that could predict a company's stock price trend with approximately 80% accuracy.
* Built an ARIMA model that could predict the future values of a stock's price for the next [5] periods
